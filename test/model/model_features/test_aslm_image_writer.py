def test_zarr_byslice():
    """
    This function will create a simulated 3D data set that is in the shape of a capital F. The pixel size can be set to any desired size
    for testing.
    Numpy linspace and meshgrid are used to create the F shape. A boolean constraint is set to create the shape directly.
    The rest of the setup comes from setting the amount of zslices, channels and the duration of the acquisition. 
    A fake frame is list is created that is tied to a fake acquisition list of 'frames' just like the camera would provide.
    The data buffer for the dummy model is set, ImageWriter is instantiated for access to saving functions.
    Then the write_zarr function is called with the list of frame ids.
    The final check is to loop thru each frame and do a check to see if they all equal the original letter F we gave at
    the beginning. 
    A fail message will appear upon failure of test ie one of the frames did not match
