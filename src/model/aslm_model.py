        FOR ANNIE: We control different hardware elements using different mechanisms.  The laser is controlled by
        The laser is turned on/off by sending a digital signal.  This is either 0V or 5V.  This signal is sent by the
        daq card.  You can see in the configuration file where these signals are physically connected.
        Likewise, the intensity is controlled by an analog signal.  0V is the lowest intensity and 5V is the highest.
        We need to make sure that we do not send signals that are negative, or greater than 5V.  This is also specified
        in the configuration file.

        For example, the wavelength, laser_0_wavelength, is 488 nm.
        The digital output channel for laser_0 is PXI6733/port0/line2
        The analog output channel for laser_0 is PXI6733/line5.
